What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It sets up all the entries needed to setup a git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Files in the working area are the work in progress
Files in the staging area are ones that are done and ready for commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Make sure you commit before you add another file to the staging area. Only one file in the staging area at a time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are good for trying out different ideas while leaving your master in tact

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It shows how you branch off the master especially if you have multiple branches for multiple ideas

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging 2 branches merges the changes of both branches. That in turn can be a new branch or can become the new master.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Not sure there are pros for Git automatic merges. I rather manual merge when I feel the branches are bugfree and are ready to be merged.
