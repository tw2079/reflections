Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forking is getting a copy of someone else's master to your profile yet remembering who the parent master is.
Cloning simply makes a copy of a repository and have no connection to the original master.
Branches are within your own repository but are for you to test changes without changing the master.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you are going offline and will be making changes while on a flight. It's good to have a baseline of how things were before you started making your changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

There will need to be a lot of communication between you and your collaborator but without git it github, it will be hard to track the collaboration and changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
